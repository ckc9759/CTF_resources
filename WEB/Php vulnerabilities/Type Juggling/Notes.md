Code : 

```php
<?php
$var1=1;
$var2=1.0;
$var3="chaitanya";
$var4=true;
?>
```

- In php, we don't need to specify the type of variables.
- Type Juggling is not a vulnerability or flaw,rather it is a feature of php.
- PHP is a loosely typed language, and hence, capable of taking the data type of the value, as that of the variable, to which that value is assigned.

```py
* there are two types of comparison in php , loose comparison(== / !=) and strict comparison (=== / !==) . 
```
