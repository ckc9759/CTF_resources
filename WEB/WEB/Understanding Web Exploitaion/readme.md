### N o T e S

---


When we open any website, our computer communicates with a known DNS ( Domain Name System ) server to find out where the website is located on the internet.
The DNS server will return an IP address for the remote server.

Your browser is given the address of a website (i.e. ckc.com). It sends this address off to a DNS server, which tells it the "co-ordinates" (the IP address) of the site.

#### HTTP (S)

```py
When the website is found, the computer sends HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server.
The method most commonly used to retrieve information is called the GET method. When sending data to the server, it's more common to use a method called POST.
 ```
 
 #### COOKIES 
 
 ```py
Cookies -- tiny little pieces of information that get stored on your computer and get sent to the server along with every request that you make. Authentication (or session) cookies are used to identify you (these will be very important in your mission today!). The server receives your request with the attached cookie, and checks the cookie to see what level of access you are allowed to have. It then returns a response appropriate to that level of access.
 ```
 
 
 #### DEBUGGER TOOLS

```py
We can use debugger tools for creating breakpoint in the js code to see some boxes or pop ups in the webpage !!
