### N o T e S

---


When we open any website, our computer communicates with a known DNS ( Domain Name System ) server to find out where the website is located on the internet.
The DNS server will return an IP address for the remote server.

Your browser is given the address of a website (i.e. ckc.com). It sends this address off to a DNS server, which tells it the "co-ordinates" (the IP address) of the site.

#### HTTP (S)

```py
When the website is found, the computer sends HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server.
