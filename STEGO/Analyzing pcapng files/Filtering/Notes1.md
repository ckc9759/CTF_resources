Wireshark filters for analyst

1. Filter by IP address:
â€œip.addr == x.x.x.x", where "x.x.x.x" is the IP address you want to filter

2. Filter by IP address range:
"ip.addr >= x.x.x.x and ip.addr <= y.y.y.y", where "x.x.x.x" and "y.y.y.y" are the start and end IP addresses of the range

3. Filter by network interface:
"interface == eth0" to show only packets captured on the eth0 interface

4. Filter by port:
"tcp.port == 80" or "udp.port == 53", where "80" and "53" are the port numbers you want to filter

5. Filter by packet length:
"frame.len > 100" to show only packets that are longer than 100 bytes

6. Filter by source or destination MAC address:
"eth.src == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" or "eth.dst == xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx", where "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" is the MAC address you want to filter

7. Filter by HTTP status code:
"http.response.status_code == 200" to show only packets with a status code of 200

13. Filter by packet size:
"frame.len > 1000" to show only packets larger than 1000 bytes.

14. Filter by DNS domain name:
"dns.qry.name contains 'example.com'" to show only DNS packets that have a domain name containing "example.com". You can substitute "example.com" with any other domain name
