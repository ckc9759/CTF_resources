### PNG 

First 8 hex codes are the png signature : following it the next 8 hex codes are the IHDR and it's chunk.

Then the next 4 hex codes are the image width and the very next 4 hex codes are image height.

Then the next 5 hex codes aren't that relevant.

After these 5 hex codes, we have the CRC check sum.
