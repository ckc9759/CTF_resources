### Notes

---

Use cat < - if the file begins with a dash.

- We can use loops for finding if a text file contains information : 
```py
for x in {0..9}; do file ./-file0$x; done
```

- To find a file with properties from a list of files and directories
```py
find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
```

- Find a file with a user, group and size 
```py
find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null 

# / root folder
2>/dev/null
```

- Human readable
```py
cat abc.txt | strings | grep ^= 
```

- Sort data 
```py
sort data | uniq -u
```

- Dir
```py
In some cases, there is a file on server. In order to work on that file we need to copy it in the tmp directory
mkdir /tmp/ckc
cp data.txt /tmp/ckc
```
