### Notes

---

Use cat < - if the file begins with a dash.

- We can use loops for finding if a text file contains information : 
```py
for x in {0..9}; do file ./-file0$x; done
```

- To find a file with properties from a list of files and directories
```py
find -type f -size 1033c ! -executable
```
