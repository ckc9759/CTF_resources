### Packets 

---

- Small pieces of Data.
- Efficient as data is exchanged in small pieces, there is less chance of bottlenecking occurring.
- Packet is the name of piece of data when we have IP information and frame is when we don't.

THREE WAY HANDSHAKE : 

```py
SYN - Initial packet sent by a client during the handshake.
SYN/ACK - Sent by receiving device (server).
ACK - Acknowledgement packet to acknowledge that a series of packets have been received.
DATA - Data is sent via the DATA message.
FIN - Properly close the connection once it's complete.
```
