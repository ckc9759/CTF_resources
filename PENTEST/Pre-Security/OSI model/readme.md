### OSI MODEL

---

Open Systems Interconnection Model

It consists of 7 layers : 

```py
- Application
- Presentation
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data link
- Physical
```

---

#### `Application Layer` - User interacting layer. DNS and GUI
#### `Presentation Layer` - Standardisation takes place, translator for app. layer data.
#### `Session Layer` - Intiates connection and creates a session once the connection is established. Converts data to chunks called packets.
#### `Transport Layer` - Transmitting data accross a network. Follows one of the protocols once data is sent : TCP or UDP.
#### `Network Layer` - Routing and Re-assembly of data. Everything is dealt via IP. (OSPF - Open shortest path first, RIP - Routing Information Protocol.)
#### `Data Link` - Physical addressing of transmission. MAC - media access control. NIC - Network interface card.
#### `Physical` - Easiest to grasp. Hardware components. Eg - Ethernet cables.
