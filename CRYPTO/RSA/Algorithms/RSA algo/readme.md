### Readme

---

RSA algo is an assymetric cryptography algorithm.


```py
Assymetric --> 2 keys private and public key.

The concept of RSA is that it is hard to factorise a large integer.

Public key --> N, which is a product of 2 large prime numbers `p` and `q`.

The private key is also derived from the two prime numbers p and q.
