### Coppersmith attack

---

```
The Coppersmith attack is a specialized attack in cryptography, particularly on RSA when small public exponents (like e=3) are used and certain conditions on the ciphertext and plaintext are met. It's typically used to recover small roots of a polynomial modulo an integer, and is a complex attack involving lattice reduction techniques like the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) algorithm.
