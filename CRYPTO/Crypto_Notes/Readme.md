### Cryptography

---

- Cryptography is used to protect confidentiality, ensure integrity, ensure authenticity. You use cryptography every day most likely, and you’re almost certainly reading this now over an encrypted connection.

```
Basic Concepts

 Plaintext - original message
 Ciphertext - coded message
 Cipher - algorithm for transforming plaintext to ciphertext
 Key - info used in cipher known only to
 Encipher (encrypt) - converting plaintext to ciphertext
 Decipher (decrypt) - recovering ciphertext from plaintext
 Cryptography - study of encryption principles/methods
 Cryptanalysis (code breaking) - study of principles/ methods of study of
principles/ methods of deciphering ciphertext without knowing key
 Cryptology - field of both cryptography and cryptanalysis
